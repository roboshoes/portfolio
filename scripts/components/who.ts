                    <h2>WHO</h2>

                    <p>
                        Mathias is a freelance, award winning creative developer. He wrote this intro
                        in third-person to appear serious and professional, but make no mistake: Itâ€™s merely
                        a facade to the playful and at times silly coder that was born and raised in
                        Austria, and currently resides in Oakland.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I spent years working at world-class agencies such as B-Reel, Firstborn and most
                        recently worked as a Creative Engineer at Google.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the last decade I have worked with clients of all sizes, from
                        huge international corporations to small projects executed by a single person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Past work has come in all forms and shapes. Websites, Apps, VR/AR, IoT, you name. If it's
                        programmable I can build with it.
